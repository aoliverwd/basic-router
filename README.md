# Basic Router

This application is a minimalistic yet powerful PHP class designed to handle routing in web applications. It's a dependency-free solution that offers a straightforward approach to mapping HTTP requests to specific PHP functions or methods.

## Installation

Preferred installation is via Composer:

```bash
composer require alexoliverwd/basic-router
```

## Basic Usage

When a request comes in to the application, the Router instance will examine the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the requested URL. If a matching route is found, the associated callback function will be executed.

### Attribute-Based Controller Routing

Attributes provide a modern, native way to declare route metadata directly in your code. This approach is now recommended for defining routes, while conventional methods will remain supported for compatibility.

```php
use AOWD\Router;
use AOWD\Attributes\Route;

class myRoutes {
    #[Route('/hello-world', 'get')]
    public function homeGet(): void
    {
        echo "GET - Hello World";
    }

    #[Route('/hello-world/segment/[0-9]+', 'get')]
    public function homeGetSegment(Router $router): void
    {
        echo $router->getSegment(1);
    }

    #[Route('/hello-world', 'post')]
    public function homePost(): void
    {
        echo "POST - Hello World";
    }
}

$router = new Router();
$router->registerRouteController(new myRoutes());
$router->run();
```

### Conventional Method

```php
use AOWD\Router;

$router = new Router();

$router->register('GET', '/', function () {
    echo 'get';
});

$router->register("get", "/second/segment/[0-9]+", function () use ($router) {
    echo $router->getSegment(1);
});

$router->run();
```

In this example, if a GET request is made to the root URL (/), the function function () { echo 'get'; } will be called, and the string "get" will be output.

### Registering an endpoint

The `register` method registers a new route in the routing system.

#### Parameters

1. Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. Route: The URL pattern for the route.
3. Callback: The callable function or method to be executed when the route is matched.

#### Return Value:

- true: If the route is successfully registered.
- false: If the route already exists for the specified method.

### Executing registered routes

The `run()` method is the core of the routing system. It's responsible for:

1. Parsing the Request: Extracts the requested URL path and HTTP method from the server environment.
2. Matching Routes: Compares the parsed request against registered routes to find a matching route.
3. Executing Callback: If a match is found, the associated callback function is executed.
4. Handling 404 Errors: If no match is found, the registered 404 error handler is invoked.

### Unregistering an endpoint

```php
$router->unregister('get', '/get');
```

This method unregisters a previously registered route from the routing system.

#### Parameters

1. Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in lowercase.
2. Route: The URL pattern of the route to be unregistered.

#### Return Value:

- true: If the route is successfully unregistered.
- false: If the route doesn't exist or couldn't be unregistered.

### Handling 404 errors

```php
$router->register404(function () {
    echo '404 error';
});
```

The `register404` method registers a callback function to be executed when a 404 Not Found error occurs. This allows you to customize the error handling behavior for your application.

#### Parameters

1. Callback: A callable function or method that will be invoked when a 404 error is encountered. This callback can be used to generate custom error messages, redirect to a specific page, or perform other error handling actions.

# Middleware

Middleware in this routing API provides a way to intercept and process requests before they reach your route handler. This allows you to implement reusable logic such as **authentication, logging, CORS handling, rate limiting, or response modification** without duplicating code inside your route controllers.

Middleware classes must implement the `AOWD\Interfaces\Middleware` interface, which requires a `handle()` method. When a route is matched, any attached middleware will be executed in the order they are defined.

## Usage

### 1. Creating a Middleware

To create a middleware, implement the `MiddlewareInterface` and define the `handle()` method.

```php
use AOWD\Interfaces\Middleware as MiddlewareInterface;

class helloWorld implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    public function handle(): void
    {
        echo "Hello World ";
    }
}
```

This simple example outputs `Hello World` before the route logic executes.

### 2. Attaching Middleware to a Route

Middleware can be attached to a route using the `#[Middleware()]` attribute.

```php
use AOWD\Attributes\Route;
use AOWD\Attributes\Middleware;

class myRoutes {
    #[Route('/hello-world-middleware', 'get')]
    #[Middleware(helloWorld::class)]
    public function homeGetMiddleware(): void
    {
        echo "GET";
    }
}
```

In this example:

- A `GET` request to `/hello-world-middleware` will first run the `helloWorld` middleware.
- The middleware prints `"Hello World "`.
- Then the route handler executes and prints `"GET"`.
- The final response is:

```txt
Hello World GET
```

### 3. Registering Routes and Running the Router

After defining routes and middleware, register your route controller with the `Router` and start it:

```php
use AOWD\Router;

$router = new Router();
$router->registerRouteController(new myRoutes());
$router->run();
```

## Full Example

Hereâ€™s everything combined into a single working example:

```php
use AOWD\Router;
use AOWD\Attributes\Route;
use AOWD\Attributes\Middleware;
use AOWD\Interfaces\Middleware as MiddlewareInterface;

class helloWorld implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    public function handle(): void
    {
        echo "Hello World ";
    }
}

class myRoutes {
    #[Route('/hello-world-middleware', 'get')]
    #[Middleware(helloWorld::class)]
    public function homeGetMiddleware(): void
    {
        echo "GET";
    }
}

$router = new Router();
$router->registerRouteController(new myRoutes());
$router->run();
```
